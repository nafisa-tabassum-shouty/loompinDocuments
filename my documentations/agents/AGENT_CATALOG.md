## 🏗️ Orchestration & Root Systems
The "Neural Connectors" that manage the high-order logic and routing within the swarm.

| System Name | Functionality Description | Connection & Example Scenario |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AgentOrchestrator** | Coordinates the entire agentic ecosystem. It handles agent registration into functional squads, manages lifecycle initialization, and provides the top-level API for complex cross-squad missions. It effectively acts as the "Prefrontal Cortex" of the platform, managing the collaboration of all specialized units to achieve multi-step objectives. | **Connection**: Primary interface for the API to interact with the swarm. <br>**Example**: Receives a "Quarterly Health Audit" request and dispatches tasks to the Analytics, Strategy, and Ops squads. |
| **SmartRouter** | An advanced, LLM-driven semantic dispatcher. It parses natural language task descriptions to determine the optimal agent for execution by comparing the request against agent domain descriptions. It ensures that specialized tasks are handled by the most qualified AI, preventing "expert mismatch" during complex workflows. | **Connection**: The core decision engine for the `AgentOrchestrator`'s auto-routing protocol. <br>**Example**: A user asks, "Why did our retention dip in Europe?" — SmartRouter identifies `PredictionAgent` and `MarketAgent` as the best handlers. |
| **AgentFactory** | A dynamic instantiation engine that scans for "Skill" definitions (Markdown files with structured prompts). It wraps these instructions into standard `SmartAgent` classes on the fly, allowing the platform to gain new specialized abilities without recompiling code. This enables rapid deployment of new expert personas as business needs evolve. | **Connection**: Enables infinite extension of the agent ecosystem through simple documentation. <br>**Example**: A developer adds a `GDPR-Auditor.md` file; AgentFactory immediately registers a new agent capable of scanning for compliance risks. |
| **DebateChamber** | Implements "Swarm Intelligence" protocols to reduce AI hallucinations and refine strategy. It sets up a structured discourse between a "Proponent" (e.g., Strategy) and an "Opponent" (e.g., Risk) to find flaws in a plan before it is presented to the user. This adversarial approach ensures that all proposed missions are pressure-tested against operational and financial reality. | **Connection**: Facilitates high-stakes decision-making within the `AgentOrchestrator`. <br>**Example**: Strategy proposes a major price hike; Risk identifies a likely 20% churn spike; Debate results in a tiered loyalty discount proposal. |
| **Orchestrator (LangChain)** | A specialized, low-latency pipeline built on LangChain. It enforces a strict "Guardian -> Analyst -> Responder" sequence for individual feedback signals, ensuring that safety audits and PII redaction occur at the edge, before any deep thematic analysis or customer-facing communication is drafted. | **Connection**: Manages the high-frequency "In-the-Moment" response loop for the VoC dashboard. <br>**Example**: Parses a tweet, checks for PII, extracts sentiment, and drafts a public reply in seconds. |

## 🤖 Squad Agents (Execution Layer)
Specialized agents grouped into functional squads (Conversation, Strategy, Knowledge, etc.) to perform deep, focused work.

| Agent Name | Functionality Description | Connection & Example Scenario |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **VoCAgent** | The primary thematic intelligence engine. It utilizes Gemini 3.0 Pro to cluster massive datasets of qualitative feedback into logical, strategic themes. It identifies patterns that humans might miss, such as a shift in tone across specific user segments or emerging "fringe" complaints that indicate future widespread issues. | **Connection**: Feeds thematic clusters to `RoadmapAgent` for product prioritization. <br>**Example**: Identifies that 40% of "App Crash" complaints are specifically related to the new "Dark Mode" feature. |
| **PlanningAgent** | A logical reasoning engine that specializes in goal decomposition. When given a vague high-level objective, it breaks it down into a sequence of atomic tasks, identifies the agents needed for each, and manages the execution flow and state. This agent ensures that multi-step projects remain on track even when they require collaboration across 5+ different AI specialists. | **Connection**: Orchestrates multi-step missions that require collaboration between diverse squads. <br>**Example**: "Help us win back the APAC market" -> dispatches `MarketAgent` (research), `StrategyAgent` (plan), and `ActionAgent` (campaign). |
| **ActionAgent** | The platform's automated executor. It generates ready-to-use artifacts like email drafts, Jira tickets, or Slack announcements based on the "Verdicts" of other agents. It can be configured for single-click human approval or fully autonomous operation, serving as the bridge between "Thinking" and "Doing." | **Connection**: Acts on the final results produced by `VoCAgent`, `ChatAgent`, or `PredictionAgent`. <br>**Example**: Creates a "High Urgency" Jira ticket for the engineering team the moment a widespread outage is detected in feedback. |
| **LibrarianAgent** | Manages the system's "Long-Term Memory" using Vector RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). It embeds technical documentation, past feedback history, and standard operating procedures into a searchable index, enabling all other agents to ground their answers in platform-specific facts and avoid generic "hallucinated" responses. | **Connection**: The central source of truth for all agents requiring technical or historical context. <br>**Example**: Retrieves the exact "SLA Commitment for Enterprise Clients" so the `ActionAgent` can draft a contractually accurate apology. |
| **PredictionAgent** | A predictive analytics engine that calculates probability scores for future events (Churn, Upsell, Feature Adoption). It analyzes multi-channel signals, including support ticket frequency, sentiment trends, and login activity, to identify "at-risk" customers before they even express dissatisfaction. | **Connection**: Flags high-risk segments for the `ActionAgent` and `StrategyAgent` to handle via preventative missions. <br>**Example**: Signals that a customer has a 75% Churn Probability because their sentiment turned "Hostile" during the last three calls. |
| **MarketAgent** | An external-facing intelligence agent. It tracks competitor share-of-voice, industry sentiment on public forums (Reddit/X), and news trends. It contextualizes Loompin's internal data against the broader market landscape, helping stakeholders verify if performance shifts are internal or reflection of the wider economy. | **Connection**: Essential for `StrategyAgent` to understand if a dip in sentiment is a "Loompin Problem" or an "Industry Trend." <br>**Example**: Reports that the whole SaaS sector is seeing negative sentiment due to a new privacy regulation, not just Loompin. |
| **UXAuditAgent** | A specialized code-quality inspector. It uses "Visual Simulation" to "look" at code snippets and detect design system violations, contrast issues, and UX anti-patterns before they reach production. It acts as an automated "Eyes-on" reviewer for every frontend change. | **Connection**: Gatekeeper for the Engineering squad and `EngineeringAgent`. <br>**Example**: Rejects a UI component that uses `text-blue-500` instead of the semantic `text-primary-base` token defined in the design system. |
| **DataAnalystAgent** | A natural-language interface for the database. It converts user questions (NLQ) into complex SQL, executes it against the Postgres memory layer, and intelligently selects the most appropriate visualization (Bar, Line, Pie) to represent the results. It democratizes data access for non-technical users. | **Connection**: The primary data provider for the dashboard UI and all "Metric-Aware" agents. <br>**Example**: "Show revenue by region vs. cost" -> Generates a multi-series bar chart with automated growth labels. |

It audits designs for bias and cognitive load to ensure high response quality. | **Connection**: Establishes the "Interview Script" executed by the `SurveyAgent`. <br>**Example**: Designs a "Lost Customer" survey that asks different questions to users who left for "Price" vs. "Missing Features." |
| **SurveyAgent** | An adaptive conversationalist. It conducts "Micro-Interviews" by generating dynamic follow-up questions in real-time based on a respondent's specific answers, digging deeper into root causes instead of just collecting static ratings. It makes every survey feel like a personalized 1-on-1 interview. | **Connection**: Operates the surveys designed by `SurveyDesignerAgent`. <br>**Example**: User says "The UI is confusing." -> SurveyAgent asks: "Which specific section (Navigation, Dashboard, or Settings) felt the most complex?" |
| **GuardianAgent** | The ecosystem's "Safety Valve." It automatically redacts PII (Personally Identifiable Information), filters toxicity, and ensures every piece of data processed by the platform complies with safety and privacy standards before deep AI analysis occurs. It is the core of Loompin's "Security-First" AI architecture. | **Connection**: The mandatory entry point for all incoming raw signals in the `Orchestrator` pipeline. <br>**Example**: Detects a customer's Social Security Number in a feedback field and redacts it with `[PII REDACTED]` before storage. |
| **Analysis Module AIs** | Domain experts (MerchantAI, TicketMasterAI, DevOpsAI). These agents specialize in vertical-specific metrics like "Inventory Burnout" (E-commerce), "Agent Burnout" (Support), or "Cycle Time Acceleration" (Engineering). They provide the industry-specific context that general purpose models often miss. | **Connection**: Part of the `SpecializedAgents` library called by the `Analyst` squad. <br>**Example**: MerchantAI flags a "Revenue Trap" where sales are high but returns are eroding 80% of the profit margin. |
